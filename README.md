## Circuit Details
Ring Oscillator consists of odd number of Inverters connected in Series to form a closed loop with positive feedback. These ring oscillators does not require an input other than Vdd and Vss Supply Here the number of Stages taken are 9. Frequency of Oscillation of Ring Oscillator is given by Fosc = t/(N(tphl + tplh))Where N is (odd) number of inverters tplh is a Low to High Delay tphl is a High to Low Delay of an Inverter if the Number of Stages chosen is high it reduces the power dissipation by the inverter which can be analysed by below equation.I = Q/T If the N increases, FOsc Reduces, which intern Increase the T and reduces the Iavg. From P = I.V if I reduces P also Reduces which indicates the Reduction in the power Dissipated by the Inverters.as per the Table 1 from the Reference [2] analysis of Various parameters like Frequency and Power Consumption is done for different values of Wp, Wn, and L. Transient response for Wp = 370.55 Wn = 220.55 and L =172.51 (in nm) is as shown in the Reference Wave form Taken from Reference [2].

## Circuit Design in eSim
VCO (9 - Stage Ring Oscillator) is designed using eSim and the screenshot of schematic file is shown below

## Waveform in ngspice
After creating the schematics, spice netlist was extracted with the help of esim and the necessary model files of sky130 tt transistors were included in the netlist and transient analysis was performed.
The result of transient analysis of VCO @ Vdd = 1.5 V is shown below

### Frequency Calculation

Here dx Represents TimePeriod (T) of the wave as shown in the above waveform  <br /> 
So (Frequenyc is Reciprocal of Timeperiod) Frequecny of Oscillation Fosc = 1/T  <br /> 
 Frequecny is 1 / (0.47138 * 10^-9)  <br /> 
 Hence Fosc = 2.12 GHZ  <br />
